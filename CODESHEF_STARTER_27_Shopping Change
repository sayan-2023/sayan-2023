Explanation
Test case-1: Since chef paid 100 rupees for items worth 1 rupee. He should get back 99 rupees.

//C++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	// your code goes here
	int T, x,ans;
	cin>>T;
	for (int i=1; i<=T; i++)
	{
	    cin>>x;
	    if (x<=100)
	    {
	        ans=100-x;
	        cout<<ans<<endl;
	    }
	}
	return 0;
}
