TCS CodeVita Questions #Q6

Count Pairs



Given an array of integers A, and an integer K find number of happy elements.

Element X is happy if there exists at least 1 element whose difference is less than K i.e. an element X is happy if there is another element in the range [X-K, X+K] other than X itself.



Constraints

1 <= N <= 10^5

0 <= K <= 10^5

0 <= A[i] <= 10^9



Input

First line contains two integers N and K where N is size of the array and K is a number as described above. Second line contains N integers separated by space.



Output

Print a single integer denoting the total number of happy elements.



Example 1

Input

6 3

5 5 7 9 15 2



Output

5



Explanation

Other than number 15, everyone has at least 1 element in the range [X-3, X+3]. Hence they are all happy elements. Since these five are in number, the output is 5.



Example 2

Input

3 2

1 3 5



Output

3



Explanation

All numbers have at least 1 element in the range [X-2, X+2]. Hence they are all happy elements. Since these three are in number, the output is 3.



Possible Solution

Input:

3 2

1 3 5





#Python:
n, k = map(int, input().split())
a = set()
a = set(map(int, input().split()))
a = list(a)
if n!=0:
    a = sorted(a)
c = 0
for i in range(1, len(a)-1):
    if a[i]-a[i-1]>k and a[i+1]-a[i]>k :
        c += 1
if a[1]-a[0]>k:
    c+=1
if a[len(a)-1]-a[len(a)-2]>k:
    c +=1
print(n-c)
